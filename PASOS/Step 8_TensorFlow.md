# Custom training: walkthrough

This guide uses machine learning to *categorize* Iris flowers by species. It uses TensorFlow to:
1. Build a model,
2. Train this model on example data, and
3. Use the model to make predictions about unknown data.

## TensorFlow programming

This guide uses these high-level TensorFlow concepts:

* Use TensorFlow's default [eager execution](../../guide/eager.ipynb) development environment,
* Import data with the [Datasets API](../../guide/datasets.ipynb),
* Build models and layers with TensorFlow's [Keras API](../../guide/keras/overview.ipynb).

This tutorial is structured like many TensorFlow programs:

1. Import and parse the dataset.
2. Select the type of model.
3. Train the model.
4. Evaluate the model's effectiveness.
5. Use the trained model to make predictions.

### Configure imports

```Python
Import TensorFlow and the other required Python modules. By default,
TensorFlow uses [eager execution](../../guide/eager.ipynb) to evaluate operations immediately, returning concrete values instead of creating a computational graph that is executed later. If you are used to a REPL or the `python` interactive console, this feels familiar.
```
```Python
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
```Python
import tensorflow as tf
```
```Python
print("TensorFlow version: {}".format(tf.__version__))
print("Eager execution: {}".format(tf.executing_eagerly()))
```

## The Iris classification problem

Imagine you are a botanist seeking an automated way to categorize each Iris flower you find. Machine learning provides many algorithms to classify flowers statistically. For instance, a sophisticated machine learning program could classify flowers based on photographs. Our ambitions are more modestâ€”we're going to classify Iris flowers based on the length and width measurements of their [sepals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepal) and [petals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petal).

The Iris genus entails about 300 species, but our program will only classify the following three:

* Iris setosa
* Iris virginica
* Iris versicolor

  </td></tr>
</table>

Fortunately, someone has already created a [dataset of 120 Iris flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) with the sepal and petal measurements. This is a classic dataset that is popular for beginner machine learning classification problems.



## Import and parse the training dataset

Download the dataset file and convert it into a structure that can be used by this Python program.

### Download the dataset

Download the training dataset file using the `tf.keras.utils.get_file` function. This returns the file path of the downloaded file:

```Python
train_dataset_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/iris_training.csv"

train_dataset_fp = tf.keras.utils.get_file(fname=os.path.basename(train_dataset_url),
                                           origin=train_dataset_url)

print("Local copy of the dataset file: {}".format(train_dataset_fp))
```
